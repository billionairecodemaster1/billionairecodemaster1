- 👋 Hi, I’m @billionairecodemaster1
- 👀 I have an idea to create a proof-of-stake blockchain which operates a utility coin backed by a underlying security smart-contract/token that can be used as a medium of exchange and/or collateral between users on the network based on their D.O.B plus other key, external socio-economic factors as paramaters/variables/intrs or "whatever you guys call it 🤓 & embed it into the code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking for any support to collaborate and help establish my blockchain pls.
